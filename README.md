# 🚀 Student Performance Index Predictor
 
## A GUI-based Machine Learning app built with Python & Streamlit that predicts student performance based on study hours and previous scores. This tool makes tracking student performance easy, interactive, and actionable 📊✨

## 🔹 Project Overview

This project allows educators, students, and data enthusiasts to:

Predict performance for individual students or batch predictions via CSV upload

Visualize how study hours and previous scores influence predicted performance

Load a trained scikit-learn model or fallback to a simple Linear Regression model

Use a clean, interactive GUI built with Streamlit — no coding required

This project strengthened skills in Python, Machine Learning, Streamlit, and data visualization, while also providing a practical tool for real-world use

### 🔹 Features

✅ Single & batch predictions
✅ Interactive charts & visualizations
✅ Model flexibility (trained model or default Linear Regression)
✅ User-friendly GUI
✅ Easy deployment and sharing
